# Greetings Slackers
This simple script written in basic Python will allow you to hook into the real time API of Slack and perform a greeting to every new joiner!
Usually this is used to tell new joiners about the network, the guidelines, rules, useful links etc etc

## About this Fork

This fork was created for the following reasons:

  * Use a hardcoded welcome message in code, as opposed to an
    environment variable.
  * Add the python `logging` module.
  * Bump the `websocket-client` package version to avoid a bug.
  * Add the ability to debug via a special channel that sends
    welcome message when joined.

**Important:** This branch, `develop/archivers`, auto-deploys to Heroku.
We recommend submitting changes to this branch via pull request.
