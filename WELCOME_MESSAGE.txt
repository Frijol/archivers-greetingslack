Welcome to the *Archivers Slack*!

Slack is an instant messaging app for distributed teams. We use it to co-ordinate conversation and collaboration around the archiving of potentially vulnerable government data and documents.

If you are here to discuss the Department of the Interior documents destruction request, please make your way to #doirecords (just click on the highlighted link in that word!).

Otherwise, please say hello in #introductions and let us know what you're interested in!
